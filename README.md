- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Andyproject1 or Andy Tiu

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Cryptocurrencies, NFTs, investing and programming and all things related. As this is a huge passion and lifestyle of mines i am currently in the process of applying for jobs within this space where i can use my knowledge and passion and apply this to create a career for myself in the industry i love.
 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Solidity and working on my skills as a Developer by devoting time out of my current job learning to program. With this being said i am extremely heavily invested in the space. I would like to use my skills and help build to shape the future of this spacece, i am an extremely self driven individual who loves to share the passion for Crypto to all people around me. Being self driven has allowed for me to devote a large majority of my time into this space, with that being doing research into projects and self taught programmer.
